## Multidimentional workspace design

### Rationale

The idea to change the design of MD workspace grows from the slow execution of ConvertToMD algorithm and MergeMD, 
that used in various work flows. The reason of this is the way of appending events to the workspace. The two main use
cases for appending events to the workspace are: constructing the MD workspace from the existing event workspace, 
appending the number of events to existing MD workspace (merging two workspaces). Both of this cases require "bulk"
processing of multiple events. 

In current implementation we have this code to treat all cases of appending events:

``` c++
for (size_t i = 0; i < dataSize; i++) { pWs->addEvent(DataObjects::MDEvent<nd>(
     *(sigErr + 2 * i), *(sigErr + 2 * i + 1), *(runIndex + i),
     *(detId + i), (Coord + i * nd)));
}
```

```c++
TMDE(size_t MDBox)::addEvent(const MDE &Evnt) {
  std::lock_guard<std::mutex> _lock(this->m_dataMutex);
  this->data.push_back(Evnt);
  return 1;
```

Here we can see two issues:
1. One by one event adding, in fact one by one pushing back in the std::vector.  
2. Locking the box during the adding of single events.

### Proposed implementation

The natural approach to solve this issues is some kind of ordering or groupping events to have the ability to append
different groups in non blocking manner. For optimization of memory utilizing and cache usage the best way is to have the 
continuous (in terms of memory) chunks with events corresponding to particular box, which are not fragmented during the 
splitting the box. That means we have to introduce some mapping from Z<sup>n</sup>+ (n-dimensional positive integers, 
box space) to Z+ (1-dimensional positive integers, memory space).
 
The known way for providing such mapping is using space filling curves: the discrete coordinate of the
box on this curve become the additional 1d index for any MD event and every box contains the continuous range of this 
indexes. Then we can sort the events using index and get the continuous chunks of memory, corresponding to every box. 
The most simple space filling curve is Z-curve or Morton curve and the 1d space index is called Morton number in this
case. Due to the simplicity the Morton number can be computed very fast.

### Changes to current implementation

In fact there are only a few things to change in the current implementation of MD workspace:
1. Add the index field in the box base class.
2. Reimplement addEvent() and addEvents() functions. 

### Drawbacks

1. Loosing the split factor (SplitInfo) as a parameter: automatically fixed as 2 for every axes of the box.
2. Limited precision of the box hierarchy (the depth of tree): N/n for N bit Morton number and n dimensions, but there
is the possibility to choose Morton number, that affects the performance.
3. Fixed global box, the initial box can't grow with adding next portion of events, the boundaries should be defined
once from instrument or sample geometry. 

### Optimization notes

The main bottleneck of the approach is memory access to MDEvent object. The best optimization for this is to make the
MDEvent object as small as possible. To reach this the floating point coordinates can be thrown out the MDEvent structure 
and retrieved then it is needed from the Morton number of the MDEvent. Also the Morton number can be chosen small enough 
to provide acceptable accuracy to increase performance. The most expensive part of both creating workspace and appending
new events is sorting, that could be also adopted for the specific data at some point.
