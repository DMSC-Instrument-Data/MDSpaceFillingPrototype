# Q-space conversion

A simple conversion to Q-space for the elastic case is implemented in
`EventToMDEventConversion.[h,cpp]`.

## Usage

To simplify implementation a Python script is used to convert instrument
definition files to a basic HDF5 format containing the instrument geometry. This
conversion is performed using:
```
./get_geometry.py WISH_Definition_10Panels.xml wish.nxs
```

The `QConversionDemo` is used to perform the conversion, currently it simply
performs the conversion and saves the Q-space coordinates obtained from a
conversion back from the interleaved coordinates. It can be run using:
```
./QConversionDemo -data WISH00034509.nxs -frames all -instrument wish.h5
```
