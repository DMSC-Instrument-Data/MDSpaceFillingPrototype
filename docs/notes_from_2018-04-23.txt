Conversion of floating point to integer:
- Pros:
  - Allows easy sorting for space filling curve
- Cons:
  - Cost of int conversion
  - Cost of expanding MD space
  - Loss of precision
- Sorting with >64 bits
  - Multi step sorting
    - Sort on first integer (MSB)
    - Build box structure
    - Sort each box on full number of bits
  - Memory overhead to move >64 bits
    - Moving MSB and LSB to only compare MSB in initial/coarse sort
    - Total memory usage

Sorting methods to try:
- Binary splitting using iterators to vector of all events
- Z-order space filling curve (convert coordinate to integer and sort)
  - Sort all elements
    - std::sort
    - Radix sort (boost::sort::spreadsort)
    - Bitonic sort
    - Funnel sort
  - Custom radix sort
  - Parallel algorithms
  - Cache optimised algorithms
  - External sort
- Other space filling curves

Building box structure:
- Single traversal over event vector
- Push box boundaries to stack
- When event count is over target, backtrace and pop box boundary from stack
